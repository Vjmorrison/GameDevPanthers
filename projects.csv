Pulls,950,2,"Pulls are how designers can get the player to go where we want and do what we want.  Much like a puppeteer, in this exercise you will be guiding a players via the environment, gameplay rules, and anything else at your disposal","Take an Existing project or create a new one|The game must have at least 3 objectives that the player must achieve|Each objective must contain an environmental(shape, color, lighting), and gameplay based pull to lead the player towards it."
Saving/Loading,950,2,Saving and Loading the game allows for extended gameplay sessions as well as more complex gameplay mechanics.  In this exercise you will be implementing a basic system for saving and loading both the progress as well as more complex game states,"Take an Existing project or create a new one|Create the ability to save simple gameplay values out to file|Load those values back in when the save is loaded and restore them to the game|Create a system for saving as much data as needed to replicate the state of every necessary object in a particular level, and then load that data again"
Checkpoints,950,2,"Checkpoints are similar to autosave locations, but are only persistent while the game is running.  In this exercise you will be developing a simple checkpoint system for the player","Take an Existing project or create a new one|Separate the gameplay into a series of discrete checkpoints where the state will be restored to if failed|If the player fails an objective, they should be restored to the nearest checkpoint along with a default level state appropriate for that checkpoint."

Player Learning,3000,6,"Player Learning can be defined by the ability to instruct the player towards a set information goal.  This can be how to use an ability, where objectives are often location, or even narrative concepts.  In this project you will be creating a set of gameplay scenes that teach the player a set of core concepts vital for the game.","Take an Existing project or create a new one|Take at least 3 core mechanics or gameplay concepts and design player learning experiences for them|Each experience should gradually release responsibility to the player for the material, starting with obvious visual or mechanical clues and ending with exam systems to test the player's knowledge"
Linear,3500,7,"A directed gameplay experience is sometimes exactly what a narrative calls for.  In this project you will be designing a gameplay experience that pulls the player through a set of sequential objectives, each building upon the others.",Create a Unity Game (Project build to Platform)|A set of defined objectives that must be completed by the player in a set order|Good utilization of pulls to attempt to limit the player's knowledge of the linearity of the objectives.
Educational/Serious Games,3500,7,"Learning?! In a game?!  WTF!!!?!?  Well get used to it!  If it's called gamification, tangential learning, or something else, games whose goal is the transmission of information to the player is becoming a fact in today's life.  In this project, you will explore the possibilities and limitations of trying to inform the player through a game.",Create a Unity Game (Project build to Platform)|Choose a topic or concept that you want to try and inform the player about|At least part of the information should be communicated through the gameplay and not text or visuals.
